<h1>A Second level of menu</h1>
The menu on the left is hierarchical, with second and third
levels of item. Currently selected is a second level menu.
Note how, by linking the top level item "Another Top Level"
to the page for it's first sub-level, we can make a top level
menu lead to its first child (rather than its own page)
